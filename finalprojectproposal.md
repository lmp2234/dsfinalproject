## Tentative Project Title + Ideas

Access to Comprehensive Services for NYC Asylum Seekers

## The motivation for this project

The purpose of this project is to create a resource navigation tool for
asylum seekers arriving in NYC. This tool will encompass available
shelters, medical services, temporary housing, food, insurance, etc.

## The intended final products

A detailed and comprehensive website/tool that enables visualization of
the prevalence of asylum seekers by borough (i.e., including demographic
data), services available to asylum seekers, and how to access such
services.

## The anticipated data sources

Shelters:

Medical services:
<https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Hospitals/833h-xwsx>

Translator services:

## The planned analyses / visualizations / coding challenges

Interactive Maps: people can search for what they need

Coding Challenges: Cleaning up available data, locating sources by
borough, variability and incomplete data sources, updating hours of
shelters, and potential to misrepresent what is occurring in real time.

## The planned timeline

11/10-11/15: Project Meeting with TAs (delegate tasks for everyone)

TENTATIVE 11/22: meet together to discuss findings + direction of
project

12/1: Finish coding and build website

12/4: Meet in person to screencast and finalize touches on website

12/6: Make last adjustments and submit
