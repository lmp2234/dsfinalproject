This project report will discuss the details behind our project. 

## Motivation

The motivation behind this project stems from asylum seekers entering NYC with a lack of resources on how to survive. These individuals, many of whom arrive after experiencing trauma, uncertainty, and displacement, often struggle to navigate the complex system of services and resources available to them. With increasing numbers of asylum seekers arriving in the city, providing them with a comprehensive, accessible, and user-friendly tool to help them find essential services is crucial.


## Related work

As of August 2024, over 210,000 migrants have arrived in NYC since 2022. In response to this increase, NYC has opened numerous shelters, emergency services, and has provided a myriad of social services for [asylum seekers](https://www.nytimes.com/article/nyc-migrant-crisis-explained.html). 

A significant public health challenge is how health disparities and social determinants shape the narrative behind many asylum seekers in NYC. According to the World Health Organization, migration may improve or diminish an individual's health status. That is, refugees and migrants tend to face worse health outcomes due to barriers such as restricted use or access to health services, discrimination, social exclusion, and economic exclusion. It is important to understand the health outcomes and social determinants of health of migrants (i.e., refugees and asylum seekers), to cater interventions and resources targeted at reducing disparities among migrant [populations](https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/refugee-and-migrant-health). There is a high prevalence of asylum seekers not getting the care they need and that raises concern on what ways we can minimize this barrier. One of the findings we discovered is underweight asylum seekers and how that reveals lack of accessible food banks, services, etc. that can provide nutrition to struggling asylum seekers. This represents our reasoning on exploring this issue. 

The main topics we researched for this project: [shelters](https://citylimits.org/nyc-shelter-count/#:~:text=The%20new%20report%2C%20Local%20Law,city%20standardizes%20their%20reporting%20format.), [medical services](https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Health/Hospitals/833h-xwsx), [social determinants of health](https://dataverse.unc.edu/dataverse/addhealth), and [food banks](https://github.com/NewYorkCityCouncil/food_insecurity/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file).  


## Initial questions: 

Initially, the questions we were trying to answer were: 

- How do the health-related and demographic trends of immigrants compare to non-immigrants based on ADD HEALTH data?
- What resources (e.g., shelters, medical facilities) are available to asylum seekers in NYC?
- Are these resources equitably distributed across the boroughs of NYC?

As the project progressed, we refined these questions to focus more on identifying gaps in resource availability and accessibility. Our questions included: 

- Are the current shelters sufficient to meet the needs of asylum seekers?
- Do certain boroughs have fewer medical facilities relative to the immigrant population density?
- How do the observed demographic and health-related trends inform the specific needs of asylum seekers in NYC?

During our analysis, additional questions emerged:

- Are there patterns of resource utilization among asylum seekers that might highlight barriers (e.g., language, transportation)?
- How do the services available in NYC compare to other cities with significant asylum-seeking populations?
- What are the policy implications of our findings for improving resource allocation for asylum seekers?


## Data
To explore migrant health outcomes, we used the Add Health publicly available dataset. Add Health is a nationally representative longitudinal cohort study that follows individuals from adolescence into adulthood. Participants are interviewed at multiple time points (i.e., waves). The study design and diversity of the sample in this study enables health disparity research for immigrant populations as researchers sampled first-generation, second-generation, and third-generation immigrants. While Add Health consists of five waves of data collection, the publicly available dataset contains up to Wave 4. For our analysis, we utilized Wave 1 data to obtain demographic characteristics and construct the generation variables, and Wave 4 for the health outcome data. Wave 4 interviews were completed in 2008 when the sample was between the ages of 24 and 32. Wave 4 was also the first wave to explore biological measures such as blood pressure and blood cholesterol. 

Wave 1 and Wave 4 data were obtained from the UNC Research Data Management Core and imported as csv files. Wave 1 was cleaned and only the variables of interest were needed for demographics and the creation of the generation variables. The following 9 variables were selected `aid`,`h1gi14`,`h1gi14`,`h1gi13m`,`h1gi4`,`h1gi8`,`h1nm6`,`h1nf6`. These variables include the respondent identifier number, U.S. citizenship status, birth in the U.S., month and year of migration, race/ethnicity, and whether their biological mother or father was born in the United States. Wave 4 data was cleaned similarly to Wave 1 and the column names were converted to character columns to ensure R would interpret them correctly. Wave 1 and Wave 4 datasets were merged based on the common identifier `aid`. Binary immigrant generation variables were created: `first_generation` was coded as 0 if the individual was born in the U.S. or born a U.S. citizen, and coded as 1 if the individual was not born in the U.S or a U.S. citizen; `second_generation` was coded as 1 if the the individuals biological mother or biological father were not born in the U.S. and 0 if both were born in the U.S.; `third_generation` was coded as 1 if the criteria for either `first_generation` or `second_generation` was not true. 

The dataset contains `r nrow(filtered_df)` observations and `r ncol(filtered_df)` variables that explore demographic characteristics, social context, psychological factors, physical health, and behavioral patterns. We selected the following health indicators to study: blood pressure (BP), body mass index (BMI), and high blood cholesterol. Before beginning the exploratory analysis, the variables for the health outcomes, `h4bpcls`, `h4bmicls`, and  `h4id5b` needed to be filtered to ensure that any of the values that corresponded to “unknown” or “skipped” in the codebook, appeared as NA instead and dropping the NA values (i.e, we checked for missingness in the data and ensured the variables did not possess a lot of missing values prior to dropping). 

After performing the exploratory analysis for the visualizations of each health outcome, we needed to further clean the dataset for the regression analysis. That is, we created an age variable and had to standardize this since age is a continuous predictor and we wanted to ensure it was on the same scale for the analysis (i.e, contributing equally to the analysis). We then ensured that the other covariates of interest for our linear models: sex, race, education, and income were properly formatted.

## Exploratory analysis

For the Add Health data, we first created a table of counts in the dataset by immigrant generation status. The final dataset contained 257 first generation immigrants, 189 second generation immigrants, and 4730 third generation plus immigrants. 

For the BP exploratory analysis, we created a table that breaks down the counts of BP classification by immigrant-generation status. BP was classified as Normal, Prehypertension, Hypertension I, and Hypertension II. Using ggplot, we plotted BP classification for first generation immigrants only to visualize which categories most fell under. The bar plot displays that most first-generation immigrants were classified under the categories of Prehypertension and Normal, highlighting an important health outcome that many migrants may experience. 84 first-generation immigrants were classified as prehypertensive, higher than 59 second generation immigrants in the sample. Additionally, 18 first generation immigrants were classified as Hypertension I while 17 second-generation immigrants were classified as Hypertension II. Although the small sample sizes for first and second generation are small, the highest count of first-generation immigrants being classified as prehypertensive is important to note. Prehypertension is a warning sign of being at increased risk for hypertension or other cardiovascular health outcomes. Given the sample at this time period was 24 to 32, it is noteworthy that a high number of individuals are prehypertensive.   

For the BMI exploratory analysis, a summary table was created for BMI categories by immigrant generation status and a bar plot was created to visualize the classification for first-generation immigrants. Among first-generation immigrants, while the highest count is in the Normal BMI category with 68, the second highest classification is in the Overweight 25 < 30 BMI category with 57 individuals, and Obese I with 33 individuals. The counts for Overweight, Obese I, and Obese II are higher among first-generation immigrants compared with second-generation immigrants. Being overweight or obese are important risk factors for numerous chronic health conditions, and these findings highlight another migrant health need to address.

Additionally, we looked at blood cholesterol, a binary variable was coded in response to whether the individual answered yes or no to ever having been told that they had high blood cholesterol by a health professional. The summary table highlights that more first-generation immigrants responded yes compared to second-generation immigrants. However, most of the sample of first-generation immigrants responded no. Given this variable was self-reported and the age of respondents was between 24 and 32 this may have affected the results. 


## Regression Analysis Models

We conducted a linear regression analysis to assess whether being a first-generation immigrant was associated with the following health outcomes: blood pressure (systolic and diastolic), body mass index (BMI), and mean arterial pressure which were available health measures in the Add Health data set. For BP, we constructed two models for systolic blood pressure (SBP) and diastolic blood pressure (DBP). The variables for BP measures in the dataset were `h4sbp` and `h4dbp`.For BMI, we constructed one model with `h4bmi` as the outcome. We adjusted for the following covariates to isolate the main effect variable and control for potential confounders: age (i.e., standardized), race/ethnicity, education, sex, and income. 

In the model that assessed SBP, we found a statistically significant relationship between being a first-generation immigrant and SBP ( β = -2.485, p-value = 0.0027). The intercept of -2.4865 indicates that being a first-generation immigrant is associated with a 2.49 mmHg decrease in systolic blood pressure compared to second or third-generation+ individuals, controlling for age, sex, race, education, and income. For the DBP model, we found a statistically significant relationship between being a first-generation immigrant and diastolic blood pressure ( β = -1.9677, p-value = 0.0026). The intercept of -1.9677 indicates that being a first-generation immigrant is associated with a 1.97 mmHg decrease in diastolic blood pressure compared to second or third-generation+ individuals, controlling for age, sex, race, education, and income. These significant findings are important to be classified as either normal or prehypertensive compared to second or third-generation migrants. 

For the model with BMI, we found a statistically significant relationship between being a first-generation immigrant and BMI (β = -1.020, p-value = 0.0112). The intercept of -1.2040 indicates that being a first-generation immigrant is associated with a 1.20 decrease in BMI compared to second or third-generation+ individuals, controlling for age, sex, race, education, and income. This supports the exploratory analysis findings in that many first-generation immigrants were classified into the lower BMI categories, and some were categorized as being underweight as well.We also had data on mean arterial pressure, an important indicator of cardiovascular health. The intercept of -2.1415 indicates that being a first-generation immigrant is associated with a 2.1415 decrease in mean arterial pressure compared to second or third-generation+ individuals, controlling for age, sex, race, education, and income. 

The results across all regression models highlight the differential health outcomes associated with first-generation immigrant status, with immigrants generally showing lower BP and BMI values compared to other groups. These findings support the healthy migrant paradox which suggests that migrants often experience better health outcomes compared to their native-born counterparts. Despite the intercepts for first-generation immigrants being negative in the models, these findings may not be generalizable to the entire migrant population. Our data provides important insight into the complexity of immigrant health since the healthy migrant paradox does not apply in all areas of health nor to all migrants. Overall, our findings support that being a first-generation migrant is associated with important health risk factors, and providing appropriate care and support to this population is critical. 


## Discussion

Our analysis highlights several key findings regarding health trends and resources available to asylum seekers in New York City. Our analysis of the Add Health dataset revealed interesting health trends among immigrant populations. We found that first-generation immigrants were statistically associated with lower systolic blood pressure (2.49 mmHg decrease, p = 0.0027) and diastolic blood pressure (1.97 mmHg decrease, p = 0.0026) compared to second- and third-generation individuals, even after controlling for demographic and socioeconomic factors. Also, first-generation immigrants exhibited a 1.20 decrease in BMI (p = 0.0112), aligning with earlier findings that some first-generation immigrants in the sample were classified as underweight.These health trends highlight the nuanced relationship between immigrant status and health outcomes. While the lower blood pressure and BMI may initially appear to be protective factors, they could also reflect underlying vulnerabilities such as food insecurity, limited access to healthcare, or stressors related to immigration status. For first-generation immigrants, these factors might manifest as a mix of both health benefits (due to lifestyle factors from their country of origin) and risks (due to systemic barriers in accessing resources in their host country). These trends underscore the need for culturally competent healthcare services that can address the unique needs of immigrant populations.

When it comes to healthcare facilities, the distribution across the five boroughs is very uneven. Boroughs with higher immigrant populations, like Queens and the Bronx, have noticeably fewer medical facilities compared to others. For example, Brooklyn has 26 major healthcare facilities, but Queens, which is home to many immigrant families, has just 11. This uneven distribution makes healthcare access a major burden for asylum seekers in those areas. Families needing medical care in these boroughs might end up having to travel long distances for facilities with appointment availability or might face overcrowded emergency rooms or urgent care facilities in the centers near them. For immigrants already dealing with language barriers and limited financial resources, these extra obstacles can be overwhelming. Addressing this gap means not only increasing the number of facilities but also making sure they are located where they are needed most.

While investigating shelter usage in NYC, we saw that there has been a dramatic increase in recent years, with the total number of individuals utilizing shelters rising from 46,521 in 2022 to 90,798 in 2024. A significant proportion of shelter users are families with children, which contrasts with the smaller amount of single adults using these services. This tells us that the need for family-specific shelter resources is growing rapidly. At the same time, it highlights how overburdened the current shelter system has become. For asylum seekers who may be new to the city and navigating an unfamiliar system, this could make finding shelter even more challenging. Addressing these trends will require more than just expanding capacity. It calls for targeted solutions that meet the unique needs of families and vulnerable newcomers.

One of the biggest issues we encountered during this project was the lack of clear data on other resources available to asylum seekers. Services like translation assistance or immigrant health centers are crucial, but finding detailed information about them was surprisingly difficult to find. This reflects a broader systemic problem in that  if we struggled to locate this data as researchers, imagine how much harder it must be for someone new to the city and unfamiliar with its systems. For asylum seekers, who may already be dealing with language barriers and a lack of documentation, this gap in information can make it nearly impossible to find the support they need. The lack of transparency and centralized information is a glaring issue. Addressing it will require better documentation of available services and a stronger effort to make this information accessible to those who need it most.
